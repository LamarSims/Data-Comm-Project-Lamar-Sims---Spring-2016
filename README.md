# Data-Comm-Project-Lamar-Sims---Spring-2016
My Data Communication Project from College, Georgia Southern University

I have made a simple program with the thought of TCP in mind. I use Java for the programming language and use Eclipse and Android Studio
for the IDEs. I developed it for Android 5.1.1, which is what my smartphone runs. It is a messaging application between a server and
client. In particular the server is my laptop and the client is my smartphone, but other PCs should be able to connect to my server as
well. I use sockets to make the connections between my server and client and input and output streams to pass the messages between my
laptop and smartphone. The server only allows direct messaging between it and one client, I did this just to keep it simple. Through
this I have been able to make an application that allows my smartphone to connect to my laptop, through the internet over Wi-Fi, when my
laptop it is running as a server and I can pass messages between them, as if I was texting between two other phones.
